## 🚀 Features

### 1️⃣ Motion Reaction Training
- Users can **record custom movements** they want to train (e.g., punch, dodge, hand raise).
- App uses the **phone camera** to detect and learn the user's movements.
- Provides **on-screen prompts** within a **limited time window**, challenging the user to react faster.
- Helps improve **hand-eye coordination** and **motor response speed**.

### 2️⃣ Brain Reaction Training
- Asks **tricky or unexpected questions** that require quick thinking.
- Users must answer within the **time limit**, training their **mental reflexes**.
- Focuses on enhancing **cognitive flexibility** and **decision-making under pressure**.

### 3️⃣ Performance Tracking
- Tracks **reaction times**, **success rates**, and **improvement trends** over time.
- Helps users monitor their **progress** in both physical and mental reaction speed.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Setup a motion**  
   - Record a reference movement using the app  
   - Train the app to recognize it  

2. **Reaction challenge**  
   - App randomly prompts the recorded movement  
   - User must perform it **before the timer ends**  

3. **Brain challenge**  
   - App asks quick tricky questions  
   - User must **answer fast**  

4. **Progress tracking**  
   - App saves reaction time & accuracy  
   - View improvement over time

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Cloud sync for multi-device tracking  
- More advanced **AI motion recognition**  
- Multiplayer reaction challenges  
- Leaderboard & gamification features  
- Exportable performance reports
